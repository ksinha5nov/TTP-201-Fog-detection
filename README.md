# TTP-201-Fog-detection

Climate change is exacerbating foggy and smoggy conditions on the coast hindering safe travel prediction in both air and on the road. Recently, satellite imagery and remote sensing methods have been found to be non-reliable in detecting fog because they work under specific conditions like the absence of other clouds above the clouds of fog. In light of these advancements, image-based fog detection has emerged as the primary approach taken by most analysts. Our study is based on comparing different statistical methods used for image processing and identifying which method can provide the most accurate identification of fog. We used a set of 9 features to identify in the image which helped us analyze the various statistical machine learning models. After running analysis on supervised methods like KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, our results have shown that KNN and Random Forest are most precise and accurate with high recall and F-1 score. Feature Importance analysis suggests that \texttt{dark\_channel\_prior} and \texttt{mscn\_var} make up the most important variables in classifying images as "foggy" or "not-foggy".
